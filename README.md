# I-can-talk-HTML

<h1>I can talk HTML app</h1>
<p>The idea behind this project is computer to be able to listen human commands and synchronously write HTML content, eventually apply CSS classes and using JS. Right now, it is basic. The HTML file inside this folder will talk about itself</p>

<ol>
	<ul>You have to run this HTML on localHost</ul>
	<ul>You can say basic commands and see what is going to happened (Everything with script is currently in one HTML file)</ul>
	<ul>You can add your own commands and collaborate with me</ul>
</ol>
<ol>Commands avalible now:
<li>say: Create div with (something)  - Will create div on DOM with text</li>
<li>say: Create header with (something) - Will create h1 on DOM with that text</li>
<li>say: Weather - Will tell you weather on your current location!</li>
<li>say: What is the weather today - Same</li>
<li>say find *word - will add word tho the array of interests (check console!) </li>
<li>say: Tell me a joke - will tell you random Chuck Norris joke!  </li>

</ol>
